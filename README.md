This MediaWiki project deals with the fact that each Wikipedia has its own CSS styles, JS gadgets, and templates. It's most a good thing, because it gives each language community the freedom to customize and innovate. But there's also a problem: these things may be useful in other languages, too, and it's hard to port them. Most MediaWiki developers are aware of the customization in the language they speak - mostly English, and to a lesser extent German, Dutch, Russian and French. And they aren't even aware of the useful developments in other languages. And they may not be aware that a customization that works in their language is not available in other languages. This is will help all developers as well as contributors by making their work easier.


Work done for MediaWiki:
1) There are small blue buttons that allow adding of useful edit summaries. There are similar tools in Polish, Hebrew, and maybe a couple of other languages. And it can be useful to all languages.So I have written a few pages that describes how is it implemented now, how is it useful, and what should be done to make this localizable and portable.

2) On the English Wikipedia there's a useful "Cite toolbar", which appears when you are editing an article. My task was to:

  a) Describe how this toolbar works at the English Wikipedia.
  b) Make a list of English strings that will have to be translated to other languages to make this toolbar fully       translated to any language.
  c) Describe which templates does this extension insert.
